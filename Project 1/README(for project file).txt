In order to run the code, open the 'project.py' file in your preferred software (I used pyCharm). Then press the run button.
I didn't write my code in an object oriented fashion so all my lines of codes that actually tells the program to run are at the bottom of the file.
I have included several prints at the bottom that outputs my entropy tree, gini tree, entropy accuracy, gini accuracy, 
sklearn entropy accuracy and sklearn gini accuracy respectively.
